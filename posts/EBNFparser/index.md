## EBNF Parser in Java

before my vacation and after my semester exams, 
I thought it would be a good idea to start reading a book on compilers and interpreters. 

#### Usage 

```bash
ebnfParser ~/example.txt
```

```bash
> Welcome to the interactive parser
> 1 + 1
> ✔️ Correct

> a-- 
> ❌ Wrong
```

```bash
.exit
Good bye
```
